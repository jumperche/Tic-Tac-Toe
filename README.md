## How to Play

1. **Run the script**: Execute the script in an R environment (such as RStudio or the R terminal).
2. **Choose who starts**: The script will ask if you want to start the game. Enter `j` (yes) to start or `n` (no) to let the computer begin.
3. **Make your move**: Enter your move in the format `row,column` (e.g., `1,2` to place your mark in the top-middle position).
4. **Computer's turn**: The computer will make its move automatically.
5. **Game progress**: The game alternates between the player and the computer until:
   - Either the player or the computer wins, or
   - All positions on the board are filled (resulting in a draw).

## Functions Overview

### 1. `print_board(board)`
Displays the current state of the game board in a user-friendly format.

Asks the player if they want to start the game and returns `1` if the player starts or `2` if the computer starts.

### 3. `get_player_input(board)`
Prompts the player to enter a valid move. Ensures that the input is in the correct format and the selected position is unoccupied.

### 4. `get_computer_input(board, player)`
Calculates the optimal move for the computer:
   - Prioritizes moves that allow the computer to win.
   - Blocks the player from winning.
   - Otherwise, makes a random move.

### 5. `check_win(board, player)`
Checks if the specified player has won the game by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.

### 6. `play_game()`
The main game loop:
   - Alternates turns between the player and the computer.
   - Ends when either the player or the computer wins or the game results in a draw.
